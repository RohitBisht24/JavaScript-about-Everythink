    Write a program to calculate the electricity bill 
    based on the number of units consumed.

    1. 0–100 units  → ₹5 per unit
    2. 101–200 units → ₹7 per unit
    3. 201+ units   → ₹10 per unit

    Additional Conditions:

    4. If the user enters negative units, print "Invalid Input".
    5. If the user enters 0 units, the bill should be ₹0.
    6. Add a fixed meter charge of ₹20 to every bill.
    7. Add 5% electricity tax on the final bill amount.
    8. If units are more than 300, add an extra surcharge of ₹100.
    9. OPTIONAL: If units are 80 or less, give a 10% discount for low usage.

    Your task:
    - Take input for units.
    - Apply the slab rates.
    - Add meter charge, tax, discount, or surcharge as applicable.
    - Print the final bill.
